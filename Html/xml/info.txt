-XML: eXtensible Markup Language
-xml is used to store and transfer the data over internet
-to store data in xml file we have to use tags , like we use in html but here tags are user defined
-all opening tags must be closed
-closing tags must fully match with the opening tags
-there must be only 1 root element
-after minimisation the whole document can be converted into one element
-XML declaration:
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
-Difference between XML and html
            XML                                                   HTML
    in xml the tags are user defined                 the tags are pre-defined
    each opening tag must have a closing tag         some tags dont have closing tag example: <br>
    tags are case sensitive                          tags are not case sensitive ie. we can write <body> and <BODY> both are fine
    used for storing and transfer the data           used for display of the web page
