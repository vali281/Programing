            Hi, I’m @vali281

        <p>
            👀 I’m interested in coding, editing, and building fun projects like Discord bots and games. <br>
            🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, along with Python for Discord bot development. <br>
            💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially related to game development and bot creation. <br>
            📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via Discord! <br>
            😄 Pronouns: He/Him <br>
            ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a tic-tac-toe game for my Discord bot with a dynamic difficulty system! <br>
